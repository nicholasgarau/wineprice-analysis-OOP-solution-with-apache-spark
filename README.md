# Wineprice analysis using Apache-Spark
## Info and project's structure: 
The purpose of the repository is to build an OOP project (for an academic exam of Big Data LAB) using Pyspark. To do this, i have
created a Jupyter Notebook file (wineprice_conPL.ipynb) that you could find in the repo, and then 
i try to build some classes to do the same things.

## Goal of the project:

The aim of the project is to forecast a wine's price given certain characteristics as the winery, the rating, the number of the
people that rate a wine, the year, the region, the variety etc.
